Agents have shell access, and with it, they can write and run code to automate anything, like browser actions.

Agents also have memory(vector and graph databases) where they index interactions with the world. Agents might use shell access to connect and manage DB.

Write code so that agents talk to each other until they accomplish a task, they review each other, and there are coded limits that control their results, process and cost.

Here is a list of tasks increasingly complex so that agents can know if their code allows them complete them:

show working directory
write a plan in a file to create an online business using AI
write code for the plan
run or deploy code
test code is giving value to users
test and monetize AI tools from other creators, agent is able to pay with a credit card or web3 wallet
