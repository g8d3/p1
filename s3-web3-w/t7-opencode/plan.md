# Solana DEX Smart Contract Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for developing smart contracts for a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) on the Solana blockchain.

## 1. Project Setup
- Initialize a new Solana project using Anchor or a similar framework.
- Configure development environment (Rust, Solana CLI, Anchor CLI).
- Define project structure for programs, tests, and client-side interactions.

## 2. Core DEX Components
### 2.1. Automated Market Maker (AMM) or Order Book
- **AMM**: Implement a constant product (x*y=k) or similar AMM logic.
  - Define pool states (token reserves, liquidity tokens).
  - Implement swap functions.
- **Order Book (Optional)**: If building an order book, implement:
  - Limit order creation and cancellation.
  - Matching engine logic.

### 2.2. Token Program Interaction
- Integrate with Solana's SPL Token Program for token creation, minting, burning, and transfers.
- Handle wrapped SOL (WSOL) for SOL trading pairs.

## 3. Token Swaps
- Implement an instruction for users to swap one token for another.
- Calculate swap amounts based on pool reserves and slippage tolerance.
- Handle fees (e.g., trading fees for liquidity providers).

## 4. Liquidity Provision
- Implement instructions for adding and removing liquidity.
- Mint and burn liquidity provider (LP) tokens.
- Calculate LP token amounts based on provided liquidity.
- Handle impermanent loss considerations.

## 5. Security Considerations
- Implement robust error handling and input validation.
- Prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy, front-running, integer overflow/underflow).
- Use secure coding practices for Solana programs.
- Conduct thorough audits.

## 6. Testing
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all program instructions and logic using Anchor's testing framework.
- Implement integration tests to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Use mock accounts for testing external program interactions.

## 7. Deployment
- Deploy programs to Solana devnet, testnet, and mainnet.
- Manage program IDs and upgradeability.
- Set up a reliable deployment pipeline.

## 8. Client-Side Integration (Out of Scope for Smart Contracts)
- Develop a frontend application to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
- Use Solana Web3.js or Anchor's client library.

## Next Steps:
- Start with Project Setup: Initialize a new Anchor project.
