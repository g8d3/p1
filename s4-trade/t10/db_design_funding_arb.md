# You Asked:

write db design for a dex funding rate arbitrage web app, include in db all config needed nothing left in the web app code.

the web app code is a metaprogrammed code that converts DB into a web app, so you need to specify everything in the DB.

everything means: auth, authz, logging, testing, configuration, business logic.

Make the most possible parts of the application configurable. And think about the different roles and all the functions that will make their life easier.

# Gemini Responded:

Of course. This is a fascinating architectural challenge that pushes the concept of a database-driven application to its logical extreme. A metaprogrammed system where the database defines not just the data, but the application's entire behavior, requires a meticulously designed schema.

Here is a comprehensive database design for a DEX Funding Rate Arbitrage web app, structured to be entirely configurable from the database itself.

### Design Philosophy

The core principle is the separation of the **Execution Engine** (the static web app code) from the **Application Definition** (the dynamic database content). The web app code is a generic "browser" for the application logic defined in the database. It knows how to render components, process rules, and call APIs, but *what* it renders and *why* it does something is dictated entirely by the database records.

This design is broken down into eight key domains:

1.  **System & Core Configuration:** Global settings and kernel-level parameters.
2.  **Users, Authentication & Authorization:** Defines users, roles, and permissions (RBAC).
3.  **Connectivity & Data Ingestion:** Defines how to connect to DEXs and parse data.
4.  **Business Logic & Strategy Definition:** The heart of the application, defining what an arbitrage strategy is and how it behaves.
5.  **Execution & Operations:** Tables for managing live trades, positions, and transactions.
6.  **Monitoring, Auditing & Logging:** Comprehensive record-keeping for every action.
7.  **Testing & Simulation:** Framework for backtesting and paper trading.
8.  **UI & Frontend Configuration:** Defines the web application's visual layout and components for different roles.

---

### 1. System & Core Configuration

These tables control the application's fundamental state and global parameters.

| Table: `System_Configuration` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Column** | **Description & Example** |
| `config_key` (PK) | The unique name of the configuration setting. E.g., `maintenance_mode`, `global_max_leverage`, `default_notification_service`. |
| `config_value` | The value for the setting. E.g., `true`, `10`, `twilio_sms`. |
| `data_type` | `boolean`, `integer`, `string`, `json`. Helps the engine cast the value correctly. |
| `description` | Human-readable explanation of what the setting does. |
| `is_encrypted` | `BOOLEAN`. If true, `config_value` is encrypted at rest. |

| Table: `Services` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Column** | **Description & Example** |
| `service_id` (PK) | Unique ID for the service. |
| `service_name` | The name of an external or internal service. E.g., `Binance`, `dYdX`, `Infura`, `Twilio`, `Slack`. |

| `metadata_json` | Exchange-specific details like `tick_size`, `step_size`, `max_order_size`. |

| Table: `Data_Endpoints` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Column** | **Description & Example** |
| `endpoint_id` (PK) | Unique ID. |
| `market_id` (FK) | The market this endpoint retrieves data for. |
| `data_type` | The kind of data. `funding_rate`, `index_price`, `order_book_l2`. |

| `update_frequency_ms` | How often the engine should poll this endpoint (if not websocket). |

---

### 4. Business Logic & Strategy Definition

This is the most critical section, turning abstract logic into database records.

| :--- | :--- |
| **Column** | **Description** |
| `strategy_id` (PK) | Unique ID for the strategy. |
| `strategy_name` | Human-readable name, e.g., "ETH Cross-DEX Basis Trade". |

**Example of a rule:** To express `(funding_dydx - funding_binance) > min_rate_spread`, you'd need a function `calculate_spread` and a rule like:
* `left_operand_type`: `FUNCTION`, `left_operand_value`: `calculate_spread('dydx_eth', 'binance_eth')`
* `operator`: `GT`
* `right_operand_type`: `PARAMETER`, `right_operand_value`: `min_rate_spread`

---

### 8. UI & Frontend Configuration

This domain makes the frontend itself metaprogrammed. The engine reads these tables to know what to render for a given user role.

| Table: `UI_Views` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `view_id` (PK) | Unique ID. |
| `view_name` | The name of the view/page. `Dashboard`, `StrategyEditor`, `UserManagement`. |

| `view_id` (FK) | Maps which roles can see which views. |
| `role_id` (FK) | |

| Table: `UI_Components` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `component_id` (PK) | Unique ID. |
| `view_id` (FK) | The view this component belongs on. |

| `grid_position_json` | `{"x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 6, "height": 4}` for CSS grid placement. |
| `config_json` | Component-specific configuration. For a table: `{"title": "Open Positions", "source_table": "Positions", "columns": ["status", "net_pnl_usd"]}`. For a chart: `{"title": "Portfolio Value", "query": "SELECT timestamp, value FROM portfolio_history WHERE user_id = ?"}`. |

This database design provides a robust foundation for a truly metaprogrammed application, ensuring maximum flexibility and control for all user roles, from traders defining complex logic without code to admins reconfiguring the UI on the fly.

# You Asked:

What about if we write user stories and check if everything is covered?

Here's one user story, a trader goes to theappdomain.com, page shows a table with arbitrage opportunities sorted by default by apr, each row shows several important fields like how much money can be put in the strategy, and a button to deposit.

Given trader might have more money than what first strategy allows, it would be great that trader can automate it's deposits, maybe creating a view of the table and setting percentages for the results, example:

Trader sets filters, and sets that he will invest 100k usdt or usdc in total, but given these amounts are available:

50k
35k
35k
30k

Trader can set a percentage table like this:

% max of vault, % max of trader funds
25, 25
25, 25
25, 25
25, 25

I'm not sure this table is the best UX, you suggest please 🥺. The idea is that trader can set and forget.

Then trader can share and others can follow, for that stats are needed.


Trader signs up only using a wallet, no email needed, and start executing strategies.

Basically all strategies are funding rate arbitrage in dexes. Since filling a big delta neutral amount can be challenging, suggest how to do that, I was thinking doing it by small amounts.

# Gemini Responded:

Excellent idea. Running user stories against the design is the perfect way to see if it holds up and find any gaps. Let's break down your scenario.

### **Summary of DB Design Impact**

Your stories are fantastic and highlight some high-value features. The great news is the core metaprogrammed design is flexible enough to handle them. We don't need to change the existing tables, but we will **add new ones** to support these advanced features like automated portfolios and social sharing.

Here’s a breakdown of how each user story is covered and what we need to add.

---

### ## 1. The Trader's Main View (Arbitrage Opportunities)

This covers your first story: A trader lands on a page and sees a table of live, actionable opportunities.

**How the DB design covers this:**

This "opportunities table" doesn't exist as a static table in the database. It's a **dynamic view** generated by the execution engine in real-time.

1.  **Discovery:** The engine uses the `Data_Endpoints` table to fetch live funding rates and prices from all configured DEXs.
2.  **Evaluation:** It runs this data against all active `Strategies` and their `Strategy_Rules`.
3.  **Opportunity Found:** When a strategy's entry conditions are met (e.g., `(funding_dydx - funding_gmx) > min_rate_spread`), the engine identifies a potential arbitrage opportunity.
4.  **Display:** The UI engine then uses the `UI_Components` table to render this. The component definition would look something like this in the DB:
    * `component_type`: `TABLE`
    * `title`: "Live Arbitrage Opportunities"
    * `data_source_query`: "SELECT * FROM generated_live_opportunities ORDER BY calculated_apr DESC"

**Proposed Addition: An "Opportunities" Cache Table**

To make this faster and store calculated data like potential APR and max size, we should add a cache-like table.

| Table: `Discovered_Opportunities` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Column** | **Description & Example** |
| `opportunity_id` (PK) | Unique ID for this live opportunity. |
| `strategy_id` (FK) | The base strategy that discovered this. |
| `market_a_id` (FK) | The "long" leg of the trade. |
| `market_b_id` (FK) | The "short" leg of the trade. |
| `calculated_apr` | The projected annualized return from the funding rate spread. |
| `max_size_usd` | The max capital that can be deployed, calculated from order book depth analysis. |
| `expires_at` | Timestamp when this opportunity is no longer valid (e.g., next funding period). |

This table gets populated by the engine and is what the UI `TABLE` component actually queries. The "Deposit" button on each row would be a `UI_Component` of type `BUTTON` that triggers the allocation logic.

---

### ## 2. Automated Deposit Allocation ("Set & Forget")

You're right, the UX for that percentage table is a bit clunky. A much better and more powerful approach is to let the trader create an **"Allocator Portfolio"**. This is a higher-level strategy that manages capital allocation into the individual arbitrage opportunities.

**A Better UX:**

Instead of picking percentages for specific opportunities, the trader defines **rules for their capital**. 

* **Total Capital:** "I want to deploy **$100,000 USDT**."
* **Allocation Rules:**
    * "Allocate a maximum of **25%** of my total capital to any single opportunity."
    * "Do not invest more than **$50,000** in any single opportunity."
    * "Only invest in opportunities with an APR above **60%**."
    * "Rebalance and compound profits daily."

**How the DB supports this:**

We'll add a new set of tables for these portfolios.

| Table: `User_Portfolios` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Column** | **Description** |
| `portfolio_id` (PK) | Unique ID for this allocation portfolio. |
| `user_id` (FK) | The trader who owns it. |
| `portfolio_name` | "Aggressive ETH Arbitrage Fund". |
| `total_capital` | The total amount of capital the user has committed (e.g., 100000). |
| `asset_symbol` | `USDT`, `USDC`. |
| `allocation_rules_json` | A JSON object defining the allocation logic, similar to `Strategy_Rules`. E.g., `[{"rule": "max_pct_per_trade", "value": 0.25}, {"rule": "min_apr", "value": 60}]`. |
| `is_active` | `BOOLEAN`. A master switch to turn this automated allocator on or off. |

This `User_Portfolios` table is the "set and forget" feature. The engine will now have a new job: continuously check active portfolios against the `Discovered_Opportunities` table and automatically create `Positions` based on the user's rules.

---

### ## 3. Social Sharing & Following ("Copy Trading")

This is a natural extension of the "Allocator Portfolio" concept. If a trader creates a profitable portfolio, others might want to copy it.

**How the DB supports this:**

We just need to extend the portfolio concept slightly.

1.  **Make Portfolios Sharable:** Add a couple of columns to the `User_Portfolios` table:
    * `is_public`: `BOOLEAN`
    * `public_description`: A markdown field where the trader can explain their strategy.

2.  **Track Followers:** Create a new junction table.

| Table: `Portfolio_Followers` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `portfolio_id` (FK) | The portfolio being followed. |
| `follower_user_id` (FK) | The user who is following/copying. |
| `capital_allocated` | How much the follower has allocated to copy this strategy. |

3.  **Provide Stats:** Create a table to store historical performance snapshots. Calculating this on the fly is too slow. A background job will populate this table daily.

| Table: `Portfolio_Stats_History` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `stat_id` (PK) | Unique ID. |
| `portfolio_id` (FK) | The portfolio these stats belong to. |
| `timestamp` | The date of the snapshot (e.g., end of day UTC). |
| `pnl_pct` | Profit and Loss % for that day/week. |
| `aum_usd` | "Assets Under Management" - total value of the portfolio. |
| `sharpe_ratio` | A measure of risk-adjusted return. |

---

### ## 4. Wallet-Only Sign-Up

This is a great, web3-native feature. The database design handles this with a minor change in process.

* **Adaptation:** In the `Users` table, the `username` column will now store the user's public wallet address (e.g., `0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B`). The `hashed_password` column can be ignored or made nullable.
* **Login Flow:**
    1.  Frontend prompts the user to "Sign In with Wallet."
    2.  User's wallet (MetaMask, etc.) signs a predefined message (e.g., "I am logging into DEX Arb App at 2025-10-12...").
    3.  This signature is sent to the backend.
    4.  The backend recovers the public address from the signature.
    5.  If the address exists in the `Users` table, a session token is created. If not, a new user record is created. It's seamless.

---

### ## 5. Challenge: Filling Large Delta-Neutral Orders

Your instinct is spot on. Executing a large order instantly (a "market order") is a recipe for high **slippage**, which can destroy your arbitrage profit. The solution is to break the large order into smaller pieces and execute them over a short period. This is a classic execution algorithm problem.

**How the DB supports this:**

This logic lives in the execution engine, but it must be **configurable** from the database.

1.  **Define Execution Algorithms:** Create a table to define *how* trades can be executed.

| Table: `Execution_Algorithms` | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `algo_id` (PK) | Unique ID. |
| `algo_name` | `Instant`, `TWAP` (Time-Weighted Average Price), `VWAP` (Volume-Weighted). |
| `description` | "Executes the trade in small chunks of a fixed size over a set time period to reduce market impact." |
| `parameters_json` | Default parameters for the algo. For TWAP: `{"chunk_size_usd": 1000, "delay_between_chunks_ms": 5000}`. |

2.  **Link to Strategies:** Add a foreign key to the `Strategies` table.
    * `execution_algo_id` (FK to `Execution_Algorithms`)

Now, when a trader creates a strategy, they can select *how* its trades should be executed. The engine reads this choice and, instead of placing one large trade, it creates a "parent" trade and executes many small "child" trades according to the algorithm's parameters, ensuring minimal slippage.

# You Asked:

Now another user story, I am not sure if a developer can be counted as an user, this one is a developer using vibe coding tools to implement and improve this application.

Developer goes with all this information you are giving and vibe coding tool writes SQL to create schema and initial configuration data.

Maybe developer, or you, suggest which libraries could convert database into a functional crud web application, I would dread being that developer and seeing that:

1. Vibe coding tool wrote a lot of custom code for something that is repeated for each table.
2. Vibe coding tool delivers a package (db and code) that doesn't run or run with errors that are hard to pinpoint, errors that should be accessible to the vibe coding tool via a url maybe.

# Gemini Responded:

Of course. This is a crucial user story. The "Developer Experience" is paramount, especially when working with advanced tools. If the developer's life is hard, the project will fail.

Let's validate the design from the perspective of a developer using a "vibe coding" (AI-assisted) tool. Your concerns about redundant code and poor debugging are completely valid, but this database-first architecture is specifically designed to prevent those exact problems.

Here’s how.

---

### ## 1. Solving the Redundancy Problem: The "Engine" vs. "Instructions"

The core mistake a vibe-coding tool could make is to see 20 tables and write 20 custom sets of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) code. This would be a nightmare.

Our design prevents this by treating the database and the code differently:
* The **Database** contains the **Instructions** (What to show? What are the rules? Who can do what?).
* The **Code** is a generic **Engine** (It knows *how* to render a table, *how* to process a rule, *how* to show a form).



Think of it like a web browser. The browser (engine) doesn't have custom code for Amazon, then different custom code for Wikipedia. It has one engine that knows how to render any HTML/CSS (instructions) it receives.

The developer's primary task, assisted by the AI, is to build this **single, generic engine**. The engine would have core functions like:
* `render_view(view_name)`: Fetches from `UI_Views` and `UI_Components` to build a page.
* `render_component(component_id)`: Renders a specific chart or table based on its type and `data_source_query`.
* `evaluate_rules(rule_group, data_context)`: Processes rules from `Strategy_Rules` to make a decision.
* `check_permission(user_id, permission_name)`: Validates user actions against the `Roles` and `Permissions` tables.

With this model, the developer **never writes CRUD for a specific table**. They write it *once* for the engine, and it works for everything. Adding a new feature, like a table for `Market_News`, requires **zero new backend code**—only adding rows to the `UI_Views` and `UI_Components` tables.

---

### ## 2. The Right Tools: Converting the DB into an App Instantly

You're right to dread the idea of building this engine from scratch. Luckily, incredible tools exist that are built on this exact philosophy. The developer can tell their AI assistant to use one of these, and 80% of the work is done instantly.

These tools are often called **Headless CMS**, **Data Platforms**, or **Backend-as-a-Service**. They connect directly to your database schema and automatically generate:
* A secure and powerful API (REST and/or GraphQL).
* A fully functional admin panel for all CRUD operations.
* User authentication and granular role-based permissions.

**Top Recommendations for the Vibe Coding Tool:**

| Tool | Key Feature & Best Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Directus** | **The Best Overall Fit.** It's open-source and designed to wrap any existing SQL database. It will instantly create a beautiful, intuitive web app for managing all the tables we've designed (`Strategies`, `Users`, `UI_Components`, etc.). The developer can then focus solely on building the custom frontend that the traders will see. |
| **Hasura** | **Blazing-Fast API.** If the main priority is a powerful, high-performance GraphQL API, Hasura is king. It connects to your Postgres DB and provides an instant API with permissions baked in. The developer would then build the admin and client UIs on top of this API. |
| **Supabase** | **The All-in-One Solution.** It's an open-source alternative to Firebase. It *is* the Postgres database, the auth system, and the auto-generated API all in one package. This is great for starting a new project from scratch. |
| **Retool / Appsmith**| **For Internal Dashboards.** These low-code platforms are specifically designed to build internal tools. You connect your database, and you can drag-and-drop to build the entire admin interface in hours, not weeks. |

The developer's instruction to the AI would be: *"Using the provided SQL schema, set up a new project using **Directus**. Configure the roles and permissions based on the `Roles` and `Role_Permissions` tables."* The AI can do this, and the result is a secure, working application foundation in minutes.

### ## 3. The Debugging & Error Feedback Loop

Your idea of making errors accessible via a URL is not just good, it's industry best practice! The vibe coding tool shouldn't have to guess what went wrong.

Here is the professional way to implement that feedback loop:

1.  **Use a Structured Logging Service:** Instead of just printing errors to a console or a simple log file, the engine should send all logs (especially errors) to a dedicated service like **Sentry**, **Datadog**, or **Logtail**.

2.  **Generate Error URLs:** When one of these services captures an error, it automatically creates a **permanent, unique URL** for that specific event. This page contains the full stack trace, the user's session data, the request parameters, and everything needed for debugging.

3.  **Log the URL:** Now, we enhance our logging table to store this crucial link.

| Table: `Execution_Logs` (Updated) | |
| :--- | :--- |
| `log_id` (PK) | Unique ID. |
| ... | (other columns like `strategy_id`, `log_level`) |
| `message` | The log message. "Failed to execute trade on market 123." |
| `details_json` | JSON blob with technical context. |
| **`error_report_url`** (New) | A URL pointing to the detailed error report in Sentry, e.g., `https://sentry.io/organizations/dex-arb/issues/12345`. |
| `timestamp` | |

**The AI-Powered Debugging Workflow:**

Now, the workflow is incredibly efficient:
1.  The application encounters an error.
2.  The engine sends the detailed error to Sentry.
3.  Sentry generates a URL.
4.  The engine saves that URL into the `Execution_Logs` table.
5.  The developer (or another admin) sees the error in the app's internal logs and simply clicks the link.
6.  The developer can then **feed this URL directly to the vibe coding tool**: *"An error occurred. Here is the full Sentry report: [URL]. Please analyze the stack trace and the request payload and suggest a fix for the execution engine."*

This approach turns debugging from a guessing game into a precise, data-driven process, perfectly suited for collaboration between a human developer and an AI assistant.
