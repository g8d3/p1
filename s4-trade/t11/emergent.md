# Question 1

I'll help you build this browser-based cryptocurrency wallet generator using OKX SDK! Before I start implementation, let me clarify a few important details:
Action: Before I start building, I need to clarify a few things:

2. **Wallet Generation Logic**: How should the signature be used?

   d. All of the above

4. **UI/UX Design**: Any preferences?

   b. Clean minimal interface
   c. Your choice (I'll create something modern)

5. **Storage**: Where to store wallet data?
