web frontend app for:

@okxweb3/coin-bitcoin
@okxweb3/coin-ethereum
@okxweb3/coin-aptos
@okxweb3/coin-cosmos
@okxweb3/coin-eos
@okxweb3/coin-stacks
@okxweb3/coin-starknet
@okxweb3/coin-sui
@okxweb3/coin-near
@okxweb3/coin-tron
@okxweb3/coin-ton
@okxweb3/coin-cardano
@okxweb3/coin-solana
@okxweb3/coin-kaspa

These libraries depend on:

@okxweb3/crypto-lib
@okxweb3/coin-base

I want all of them loaded so that user can generate as many wallets he wants in the network he wants and show generated wallets in a table.

But I would like user can authenticate with its browser wallet and use a signature from that wallet to generate how many wallets the user wants using the signature, so that user can come back anytime and have access to all of his created wallets. No server needed.

It is a browser CRUD application for wallets using okx sdk.
