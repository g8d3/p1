# Testing Wallet Demo with Web3 Wallets

## Issue with Current Mock-Based Testing

The current e2e tests use mocks for `window.ethereum` to simulate a browser wallet like MetaMask. This allows testing UI flows (connect, generate wallets, sign messages/transactions) without external dependencies. However, mocks may not fully replicate real wallet behavior, such as:

- Actual signing processes or network interactions.
- Wallet-specific quirks (e.g., MetaMask popups, error handling).
- Compatibility with different wallet implementations.

As a result, tests passing with mocks don't guarantee the app works in manual testing with real wallets. Tests primarily verify UI logic and mock responses, which could miss integration issues.

## Options for Testing with Real Web3 Wallets

### 1. Install MetaMask Extension in Playwright Browser
- **Description**: Download the MetaMask extension CRX file and configure Playwright to launch Chromium with it using `--load-extension`. Automate interactions with MetaMask popups in tests (e.g., approve connections, sign requests).
- **Pros**:
  - Mimics real user experience closely.
  - Tests against actual wallet behavior and popups.
  - Catches extension-specific issues.
- **Cons**:
  - Slower test execution.
  - Requires handling asynchronous popups, which can be flaky.
  - Not fully headless; may need adjustments for CI.
  - Extension updates can break tests.
- **Suitability**: Good for local development and critical flows; less ideal for fast CI pipelines.

### 2. Use a Test Ethereum Network with a Simulated Wallet
- **Description**: Run a local Ethereum node (e.g., Ganache or Hardhat) and connect the demo to it. Inject a test wallet (e.g., ethers.Wallet) into the page for signing operations.
- **Pros**:
  - Faster than real extensions.
  - Fully controllable transactions and network state.
  - Avoids browser extension complexities.
- **Cons**:
  - Still uses simulations; misses real browser wallet interactions.
  - Requires setting up and maintaining a local node.
  - Doesn't test wallet UI or user approvals.
- **Suitability**: Balanced for integration testing without full realism.

### 3. Switch to Unit/Integration Tests for Wallet Logic
- **Description**: Move wallet-related logic (generate, sign) to unit tests using real ethers.js and mock networks. Keep e2e tests focused on UI without wallet mocks.
- **Pros**:
  - Faster and more reliable.
  - Covers core logic in isolation.
  - Easier to maintain and debug.
- **Cons**:
  - Doesn't test full e2e flows with wallets.
  - Requires separating logic from UI.
  - Manual testing still needed for wallet integration.
- **Suitability**: Best for code quality; combine with minimal e2e mocks.

### 4. Use WalletConnect or Web3Modal with Test Wallets
- **Description**: Modify the demo to use WalletConnect for QR-based connections. In tests, mock the bridge or use a test wallet app to simulate connections.
- **Pros**:
  - Modern and flexible; supports multiple wallets.
  - Avoids extension dependencies.
  - Easier to automate in headless environments.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires changes to the demo code.
  - May not cover direct `window.ethereum` integrations.
  - Adds complexity for simple use cases.
- **Suitability**: Good for apps supporting multiple wallets; overkill for MetaMask-only.

## Recommendation
For immediate improvement, implement Option 1 (MetaMask extension) to make tests more realistic while keeping mocks for speed. Long-term, combine Options 3 and 1 for comprehensive coverage. If simplicity is key, enhance mocks to better simulate real responses and rely on manual testing for validation.
