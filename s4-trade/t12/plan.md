Library that allows to easily build a browser CRUD application for wallets. No server needed.

User can generate as many wallets he wants in the network he wants and show generated wallets in a table with fixed size and scrollable cells.

User can authenticate with its browser wallet and use a signature from that wallet to generate how many wallets the user wants using the signature, so that user can come back anytime and have access to all of his created wallets. No server needed.
