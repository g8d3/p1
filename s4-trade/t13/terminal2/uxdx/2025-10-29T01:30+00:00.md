# UXDX - User & Developer Experience Analysis
## Date: 2025-10-29T01:30+00:00

### Current State
- ✅ Data persistence working correctly across page reloads
- ✅ Default aggregators and RPCs initialize properly
- ✅ No critical JavaScript runtime errors
- ⚠️ Buffer externalization warning (cosmetic, doesn't break functionality)
- ⚠️ CORS issues with 1inch API in development (using mock data)
- ❌ Duplicate aggregators reappearing on reload (fixed)
- ❌ E2E tests failing due to selector conflicts and missing UI elements

### Issues Identified

#### 1. Test Selector Conflicts (High Priority)
**Problem**: E2E tests use ambiguous selectors that match multiple elements
- `h3:has-text("Trading")` matches both "Trading" and "Trading Presets" sections
- `text=1inch` matches multiple table cells due to duplicate aggregators
- `input[placeholder="0x..."]` matches multiple inputs in different sections

**Impact**: Tests fail with "strict mode violation" errors

**Solution**: Update test selectors to be more specific using data attributes, roles, or unique combinations

#### 2. Duplicate Database Records (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: React StrictMode causes `initializeDefaultAggregators` to run twice, creating duplicate records
- 2 Jupiter aggregators and 2 1inch aggregators in database
- Doesn't break functionality but causes test failures

**Impact**: Test assertions fail due to multiple matching elements

**Solution**: Improve initialization logic to prevent duplicates more robustly

#### 3. Missing Wallet Derivation UI (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: Tests expect wallet derivation buttons that don't exist in current UI
- `text=Derive from MetaMask (EVM)` not found
- `text=Connect Wallet Extension` not found

**Impact**: Wallet derivation tests fail

**Solution**: Implement wallet derivation UI or update tests to match current implementation

#### 4. CORS Issues with 1inch API (Medium Priority)
**Problem**: 1inch API blocks requests from localhost due to CORS policy

**Impact**: Quote fetching fails in development environment

**Solution**: Implemented mock data for development, real API calls require CORS proxy in production

#### 5. Duplicate Aggregators on Reload (High Priority - Fixed)
**Problem**: Default aggregators were being created multiple times on page reload

**Impact**: UI shows duplicate entries, confusing user experience

**Solution**: Added existence check before creating default aggregators

#### 6. Buffer Externalization Warning (Low Priority)
**Problem**: Vite warns about buffer module externalization for @solana/web3.js compatibility

**Impact**: Cosmetic warning in console, doesn't break functionality

**Solution**: Configure Vite to properly polyfill Buffer (attempted but not fully resolved)

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix test selectors** - Use more specific locators (roles, data attributes, unique text combinations)
2. **Clean up duplicate records** - Add database cleanup or improve initialization logic
3. **Update test expectations** - Align tests with current UI implementation

#### Future Improvements
1. **Add data-testid attributes** to components for reliable test targeting
2. **Implement wallet derivation UI** to match test expectations
3. **Resolve buffer polyfill** for cleaner console output
4. **Add React.StrictMode guard** for initialization functions to prevent double execution

### Test Results Summary
- **Total Tests**: 95
- **Passed**: ~60 (estimated, output truncated)
- **Failed**: ~35 (due to selector conflicts and missing UI)
- **Timeout**: Some tests timing out due to element not found

### Next Steps
1. Fix critical test selector issues
2. Clean up duplicate database records
3. Update tests to match current UI state
4. Implement missing wallet derivation UI if needed
