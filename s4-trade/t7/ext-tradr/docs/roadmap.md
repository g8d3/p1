# Roadmap

## Me

Data has many dimensions, user having to think about that and then coding new presets seems something that you or another AI model could help with,
currently extension works as a piece of software that lets user or AI control the browser, what if user just set AI free with the extension and it:

1. browses crypto data websites
2. according unstructured data uses intuition to define a data box to structure
3. writes code to scrape that data, creating a preset
4. tests preset ingest data
5. uses intuition again to create or reuse technical, fundamental or social indicators to backtest in this data box
6. uses intuition again to create or reuse backtesting presets that present a clear understanding of risk reward of a given strategy
7. optional, runs best strategies and continously monitors its result and shuts them down if they diverge certain amount of backtest data

## Highest Priority

### AI-Powered Autonomous Trading Assistant

• Autonomous Browsing: Extension autonomously navigates crypto data websites to discover new data sources.
• Data Structuring: Uses AI intuition to identify and define "data boxes" from unstructured web data, creating structured datasets.
• Preset Generation: Automatically writes and tests scraping code to create new presets for data ingestion.
• Indicator Creation: Applies technical, fundamental, and social indicators to structured data for analysis.
• Backtesting Engine: Develops or reuses backtesting presets to evaluate risk-reward profiles of trading strategies.
• Live Monitoring (Optional): Runs top-performing strategies in real-time, continuously monitoring performance against backtest benchmarks and
auto-shutting down if deviations exceed thresholds.

This transforms the extension from a manual tool into an AI-driven trading platform.

## High Priority
- Add more built-in presets for popular data sources (e.g., stock markets, news sites).
- Improve error handling and retry mechanisms for failed visits.
- Add data validation and formatting options.

## Medium Priority
- User authentication for secure data sinks.
- Export/import settings and presets.
- Visual data preview in popup before sinking.

## Low Priority
- Custom preset creation via UI.
- Scheduling with cron-like expressions.
- Integration with cloud storage for data persistence.
