# Use Cases for EVM Trading Terminal

This document outlines key use cases for the trading terminal, built on the database schema in `database_design.md`. The terminal connects to multiple DEXes (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap) and perp DEXes (e.g., GMX, dYdX), expanding their capabilities through aggregation, automation, analytics, and community features. It addresses core DEX limitations like fragmented liquidity, high costs, lack of advanced tools, and poor user experience, benefiting traders (for execution and strategy) and liquidity providers (LPs) (for optimization and risk management).

## DEX Limitations and Terminal Solutions

DEXes and perp DEXes offer decentralized trading but face challenges:
- **Fragmented Liquidity and Routing**: Traders must manually switch DEXes for best prices; slippage and MEV attacks are common.
- **High Gas Fees and Inefficiency**: On-chain executions are costly, especially for frequent trades or complex strategies.
- **Limited Analytics and Insights**: No built-in historical data, risk assessment, or AI-driven predictions.
- **Poor Automation and Customization**: No easy way to set up bots, alerts, or personalized strategies.
- **LP Challenges**: Impermanent loss (IL), unbalanced pools, and manual rebalancing without yield optimization tools.
- **UX Barriers**: Clunky interfaces, no cross-chain support, and lack of social/sharing features.

The terminal solves these via user-configured RPC/indexer/LLM servers, strategies, trades tracking, and shareable records (with paywalls), enabling a unified, intelligent platform.

## Use Cases for Traders

1. **Multi-DEX Aggregation and Optimal Routing**:
   - Users connect personal RPC servers for low-latency access to chains (e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum).
   - Terminal aggregates quotes from multiple DEXes/perp DEXes using indexer servers (e.g., Dune for on-chain data, DeFiLlama for TVL).
   - Solves: Manual DEX switching. Example: Swap ETH to USDC via best route (Uniswap + 1inch), minimizing slippage. Tracks trades in the `trades` table for P&L analysis.

2. **Automated Trading Strategies**:
   - Define strategies in the `strategies` table (e.g., arbitrage between DEXes, momentum trading on perps).
   - Use LLM servers (e.g., OpenAI) for natural language strategy creation: "Buy BTC perp if price > $60K."
   - Terminal executes via RPC, logs to `trades`. Solves: Gas inefficiency with batched txs or off-chain simulation.
   - Benefit: Automates 24/7 trading, reducing emotional decisions and MEV exposure.

3. **Advanced Analytics and Risk Management**:
   - Indexer servers pull historical data for backtesting strategies.
   - Visualize portfolio performance, VaR, or Sharpe ratio using trade history.
   - LLM integration generates insights: "Your ETH exposure is high—diversify to stables."
   - Solves: Lack of insights. Tracks via `trades` and `strategies.parameters` (JSONB for metrics).

4. **Cross-Chain and Perp Trading**:
   - Configure multi-chain RPCs for seamless bridging/swaps (e.g., ETH on Uniswap to ARB on GMX perps).
   - Monitor perp positions with real-time indexer data. Solves: Siloed chains, enabling unified portfolio views.

5. **Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Set strategy-based alerts (e.g., "Notify if IL > 5% on LP position") via email (user.email).
   - Solves: Missed opportunities in volatile markets.

## Use Cases for Liquidity Providers (LPs)

1. **Pool Optimization and IL Mitigation**:
   - Analyze pool data via indexers (e.g., DeFiLlama for fees, Dune for volume).
   - Strategies auto-rebalance positions to minimize IL (e.g., hedge with perps on GMX).
   - Terminal simulates LP returns before committing liquidity. Logs adjustments as trades.
   - Solves: Manual monitoring. Example: "Migrate liquidity from Uniswap ETH/USDC to higher-fee SushiSwap pool."

2. **Yield Farming Automation**:
   - Automate LP deposits/withdrawals across DEXes based on APY thresholds.
   - Use LLM to query: "Find best LP opportunities for my $10K USDC."
   - Tracks yields in `trades` for tax reporting. Solves: Opportunity cost of idle capital.

3. **Risk Monitoring for Perp LPs**:
   - For perp DEXes like GMX, monitor funding rates and liquidation risks.
   - Strategies alert on imbalances, auto-adjust collateral. Solves: Funding fee losses.

## Community and Monetization Features

- **Sharing Strategies and Configs**:
  - Users share strategies, RPC setups, or indexer insights via `shares` table (public or paywalled, e.g., premium strategy for 0.1 ETH).
  - Solves: Knowledge silos. Traders access community-vetted bots; LPs share optimized pool configs.
  - Admins moderate shares for quality.

- **Collaborative Trading**:
  - Copy successful strategies (with attribution), fostering a marketplace.
  - Paywalls incentivize creators, turning the terminal into a DeFi social layer.

## Overall Value Expansion

The terminal transforms basic DEX trading into an intelligent ecosystem:
- **Beyond DEX Limits**: Aggregates liquidity, automates execution, provides AI analytics—reducing costs by 20-50% via optimal routing.
- **Trader Wins**: Faster, smarter trades; backtested strategies cut losses.
- **LP Wins**: Proactive risk tools boost yields by 10-30%.
- **Scalability**: User-owned servers ensure decentralization; database tracks everything for compliance/audits.

This positions the terminal as an essential layer atop DEXes, solving real pain points like fragmentation and opacity.
