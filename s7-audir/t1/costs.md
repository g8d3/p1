# Smart Contract Audit Cost Analysis

This document outlines typical pricing models and cost structures for smart contract audits based on industry reports, auditor websites, and community data as of 2024. Costs vary by complexity, scope, and auditor reputation. The app will integrate real-time pricing from auditor APIs and market data.

## Pricing Models
- **Fixed Fee**: One-time payment for complete audit (common for standard projects).
- **Hourly Rate**: Charged per hour of audit work (flexible for ongoing or complex projects).
- **Percentage of TVL**: Fee based on Total Value Locked (used for high-value protocols).

## Average Costs by Complexity
- **Simple Contracts** (e.g., basic ERC-20, small DeFi pools): $5,000 - $15,000
- **Medium Complexity** (e.g., lending protocols, AMMs): $20,000 - $50,000
- **Complex Contracts** (e.g., multi-protocol DeFi, cross-chain bridges): $50,000 - $200,000+
- **Enterprise/High-Value** (e.g., major protocols like Uniswap): $100,000 - $500,000+

## Additional Fees
- **Rush Services**: +20-50% for expedited audits (under 1 week).
- **Re-audits**: 50% of original cost for follow-up reviews.
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Monthly fees of $5,000 - $20,000 for continuous security monitoring.
- **Formal Verification**: Additional $10,000 - $50,000 for mathematical proofs.

## Cost-Benefit Ratio
Audit costs typically represent <1% of potential exploit losses. For example:
- $50,000 audit vs. average $5M+ exploit loss.
- ROI: 100x+ in prevented losses.

## Auditor-Specific Cost Ranges (Estimated)
- OpenZeppelin: $20,000 - $100,000 (fixed/hourly)
- Trail of Bits: $30,000 - $150,000 (fixed, premium for research)
- Certik: $10,000 - $50,000 (fixed, volume discounts)
- Quantstamp: $5,000 - $30,000 (automated + manual)
- ConsenSys Diligence: $25,000 - $80,000 (fixed)
- Sigma Prime: $15,000 - $60,000 (fixed)
- Halborn: $10,000 - $40,000 (fixed)
- PeckShield: $8,000 - $35,000 (fixed)
- SlowMist: $10,000 - $45,000 (fixed)
- Beosin: $12,000 - $50,000 (fixed)
