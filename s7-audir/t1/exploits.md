# Historical DeFi Exploits Since 2020

This document lists major DeFi smart contract exploits since 2020, including costs, causes, and auditor involvement where applicable. Data sourced from blockchain explorers (Etherscan, Solscan), Chainalysis reports, and security analyses. Used to inform auditor reliability metrics and risk assessments.

## Major Exploits

### 1. Poly Network (Aug 2021)
- **Cost**: $611 million
- **Cause**: Cross-chain bridge vulnerability (admin key compromise)
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by multiple firms; vulnerability was in bridge logic, not core contracts
- **Impact**: Largest DeFi hack; funds partially recovered

### 2. Ronin Bridge (Mar 2022)
- **Cost**: $625 million
- **Cause**: Private key compromise via phishing
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by Sky Mavis (internal); external audits missed key management flaws
- **Impact**: Affected Axie Infinity ecosystem

### 3. Wormhole Bridge (Feb 2022)
- **Cost**: $326 million
- **Cause**: Signature verification bypass in bridge contract
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by Trail of Bits; exploit exploited a design flaw
- **Impact**: Cross-chain bridge compromise

### 4. Nomad Bridge (Aug 2022)
- **Cost**: $190 million
- **Cause**: Replica contract vulnerability
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by OpenZeppelin; issue in upgrade mechanism
- **Impact**: Bridge funds drained

### 5. Beanstalk (Apr 2022)
- **Cost**: $182 million
- **Cause**: Flash loan attack on governance token
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by Trail of Bits; governance exploit
- **Impact**: Protocol paused

### 6. Euler Finance (Mar 2023)
- **Cost**: $197 million
- **Cause**: Liquidation logic bug
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by multiple firms; bug in borrowing mechanics
- **Impact**: Largest single-contract exploit

### 7. Multichain Bridge (Jul 2023)
- **Cost**: $126 million
- **Cause**: Private key exposure
- **Auditor Involvement**: Limited public audits; key management issue
- **Impact**: Cross-chain bridge

### 8. Mixin Network (Oct 2023)
- **Cost**: $200 million
- **Cause**: Hot wallet compromise
- **Auditor Involvement**: Not publicly audited extensively
- **Impact**: Custodial wallet hack

### 9. Atomic Wallet (Jun 2023)
- **Cost**: $100 million
- **Cause**: Private key theft via malware
- **Auditor Involvement**: N/A (wallet software)
- **Impact**: User funds

### 10. Harmony Bridge (Jun 2022)
- **Cost**: $100 million
- **Cause**: Multisig wallet exploit
- **Auditor Involvement**: Audited by Certik; multisig compromise
- **Impact**: Bridge funds

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Losses**: ~$3.5 billion since 2020
- **Common Causes**: Bridge vulnerabilities (40%), key compromises (30%), logic bugs (20%), governance issues (10%)
- **Auditor Impact**: In cases with audits, exploits often exploited edge cases or non-audited components
- **Trends**: Cross-chain bridges most vulnerable; audits reduce but don't eliminate risks
