# Exploit Categorization & Analysis Framework

## Overview

The categorization framework is the core intelligence layer of CryptoGuard, designed to systematically classify, analyze, and correlate cryptocurrency exploits based on their **technical root causes** rather than financial impact. This framework enables pattern recognition, predictive analysis, and educational content generation.
